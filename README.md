# CTB Replay Editor
A lightweightâ„¢ Replay Editor for Catch the Beat

Something I started work on because I just had nothing to do.

Please note that I do not endorse the usage of my program for cheating purposes.

(Pretty much an unofficial collaboration between Holly and Me)

## Usage
Using the program is pretty straight forward, simply run the program and load your replay, the rest should be completely automated.

## Notes on building
Make sure you have the XNA Framework Redistributables installed, which you can find [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914).
