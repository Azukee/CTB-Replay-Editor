# CTB Replay Editor
A lightweightâ„¢ Replay Editor for Catch the Beat

Something I started work on because I just had nothing to do.

Please note that I do not endorse the usage of my program for cheating purposes.

## Usage
Currently using the program is a little troublesome but that'll most likely get fixed quite quickly.

* open MainForm.cs and edit the path to the osu!.db file on line 73
* do the same thing for the songs folder on line 50 and 56

and that's it

## Notes on building
Make sure you have the XNA Framework Redistributables installed, which you can find [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20914).
